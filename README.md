<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Luka</h1>
<h3 align="center">A game developer by day and a Magic: the Gathering player by night.</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [a pokemon TCG remake](https://github.com/lloncar15/NeoPokemonTCG_Unity) in Unity
  - This is just a passion project of mine that also doubles as an entry for my portfolio. I'm approaching this project as if I'm trying to make a project and push into production, but because of copyright issues, it's more just for exercise.
  - The goal of this project is to make a framework for card games for myself in Unity, so whenever I get an idea for a card game, I will eventually have the skeleton for any generic card game and just develop on top of it.
  - Currently working on implementing a base Game Action System that would handle all the logic for the underlying model
  - My goal is to implement cards all the way from the base set, until the Neo sets, while making it available for multiplayer to play with my friends and family as we grew up playing those sets.
